This mod adds, replaces, and rebalances some professions to be in a spot where, in my opinion, there is more reason to use them and more variety in them than base cataclysm bright nights offers. Currently im trying to add one profession a day until im satisfied

The release build will always work and I am going to attempt to keep it that way because im sure ill break this a few times
